# Extract Transform Load (ETL)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ETL** is the process of extracting large amounts of data from multiple sources and formats and transforming it into one specific format before loading it into database or target file.

ETL pipelines example:

1. Imagine that you have a startup using AI
2. You have to collect the data to feed your AI and the data is from CSV and JSON files
3. you have to **extract** them into one file so the AI can read it (DATA: IMPERIAL)
4. your data is in imperial but the AI uses metric units so you must **transform** it,
5. The AI only reads CSV data in on big file, so you need to **load** the data as CSV.
